Youth \\nmental health services provide various treatment programs \\nto support young people with severe mental illness [4 ]. \\nHowever, many young people find that the existing treat-\\nment programs do not fully meet their needs [1 , 4–6]. \\nTo meet the needs of these young people, it is necessary \\nthat services put more emphasis on recovery, consumer-\\ncentered care and empowerment of service users, and \\nless emphasis on traditional clinical models focusing on \\ntreating psychiatric symptomatology [6 –8].

Due to heterogeneity among included studies in clinical populations,\\npredictor measures and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted.\\nResults: We found substantial evidence from prospective studies that people with depression who perceive their\\nsocial support as poorer have worse outcomes in terms of symptoms, recovery and social functioning. Loneliness\\nhas been investigated much less than perceived social support, but there is some evidence that greater loneliness\\npredicts poorer depression outcome. There is also some preliminary evidence of associations between perceived\\nsocial support and outcomes in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders.\\nConclusions: Loneliness and quality of social support in depression are potential targets for development and testing\\nof interventions, while for other conditions further evidence is needed regarding relationships with outcomes.'),\n",

An important question in evaluating the available\\nevidence is how far loneliness is conceptually and empir-\\nically distinct from other concepts and measures related\\nto social relationships. Loneliness has been shown to be\\nonly moderately correlated with more objectively mea-\\nsured concepts such as social isolation, social network\\nsize and objective social support received from others\\n[30, 31].

In the UK, a variety of approaches to\\nsocial relationships and social participation are being de-\\nveloped primarily in the charitable sector and in primary\\ncare [ 74]. Social prescribing projects have proliferated in\\nthe UK in recent years [ 75]. Social prescribing is not pre-\\ncisely defined, but typically refers to: navigation - the\\nprocess of linking support for people to access community\\nactivities helpful to wellbeing and participation; and/or\\nfunding and providing these activities in a community or\\ngroup setting [ 76]. As yet however, social prescribing\\nmodels are numerous and poorly defined [ 75], and there\\nis a lack of robust evidence regarding their effectiveness\\n[76]. Psychological approaches, such as Cognitive Behav-\\nioural Therapy and Mindfulness, have also been used to\\nhelp people change their thinking about social relation-\\nships: some promising results have been reported, espe-'),\n",

A mental health con-\\nsumer and advocate declared similarly that: ‘…because of\\nthe stigma attached with mental illness…the last thing\\nyou want to do is to go into the system and seek help’.\\nThe conventional understanding of mental health\\nproblems as implying irremediable insanity leads to a fear\\nabout what happens to people who become clients within\\nthe mental health care system.

A minister of religion offered a similar assessment,\\nthat people identified mental health problems as being an\\nunmanageable condition that is: ‘…something psychiatric,\\nincurable and (that would) send you straight to the inside.’\\nWhile informants defined mental health problems\\nacross the board, they thought that the view in their com-\\nmunity was that mental health problems were equated with\\n‘insanity’. One consequence of this may be that people do\\nnot identify their own individual distress as a ‘mental\\nhealth problem’. A rural financial counsellor, often dealing\\nwith people in great emotional distress pointed out: ‘…I\\nhaven’t had one person ring me and say, “I’m having a\\nmental health problem”. In 8 years, it’s always under the\\nguise of a financial problem.’ It is as if the very term ‘men-\\ntal health problem’ is alien to people.
